Deep Learning Final Project 2024 - Rishie Nandhan Babu and Andrew Giordano

In the notebook titled 'SAM_finetune_Axon.ipynb', you'll find well-documented code along with detailed explanations of the proposed framework.

Most of the files used in this project were too large to be uploaded to github, so the intermediate files, stored in png_images and png_masks, are uplodaded instead. From the section labeled Reload Data onward, these files can be used to train the SAM model.
